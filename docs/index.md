A tool for making apps for non-programmers

## Can I use it yet?

Stacksmith is still in development, and not yet really suitable for use by non-programmers.

## What is it?

Stacksmith is a software erector set inspired by HyperCard, but free from the constraints of computers of the time. Stacksmith aims to update HyperCard in ways that follow its spirit, but were not feasible back then.

The main goal behind HyperCard, as the Stacksmith understands it, was to create a software builder that can be understood by non-technical people. Not a language, but an app that uses real-life metaphors to enable less technical people to create their own software. It should take advantage of existing world knowledge and not expect the scripter to learn its model, and should be as forgiving as possible when it comes to requiring methodical or logical thinking.
